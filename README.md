# Quaternions in numpy

This Python module adds a quaternion dtype to NumPy.

The code was originally based on [code by Martin
Ling](https://github.com/martinling/numpy_quaternion) (which he wrote
with help from Mark Wiebe), but has been rewritten with ideas from
[rational](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-dtypes/tree/master/npytypes/rational)
to work with both python 2.x and 3.x (and to fix a few bugs), and
*greatly* expands the applications of quaternions.

## Quickstart

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge quaternion
```

or

```sh
pip install --user numpy numpy-quaternion
```


## Dependencies

The basic requirements for this code are reasonably current versions
of `python` and `numpy`.  In particular, `python` versions 2.7 and 3.6
are [routinely tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion).  Also,
any `numpy` version greater than 1.13.0 should work, but the tests are
run on the most recent release at the time of the test.

However, certain advanced functions in this package (including
`squad`, `mean_rotor_in_intrinsic_metric`,
`integrate_angular_velocity`, and related functions) require
[`scipy`](http://scipy.org/) and can automatically use
[`numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/).  `Scipy` is a standard python
package for scientific computation, and implements interfaces to C and
Fortran codes for optimization (among other things) need for finding
mean and optimal rotors.  `Numba` uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) to
compile python code to machine code, accelerating many numerical
functions by factors of anywhere from 2 to 2000.  It is *possible* to
run all the code without `numba`, but these particular functions are
roughly 4 to 400 times slower without it.

The only drawback of `numba` is that it is nontrivial to install on
its own.  Fortunately, the best python installer,
[`anaconda`](http://continuum.io/downloads), makes it trivial.  Just
install the main `anaconda` package, which installs both `numba` and
`scipy`.  If you prefer the smaller download size of
[`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) (which comes
with minimal extras), you'll also have to run this command:

```sh
conda install numpy scipy numba
```


## Installation

Assuming you use `conda` to manage your python installation (like any
sane python user), you can install this package simply as

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge quaternion
```

If you prefer to use `pip` (whether or not you use `conda`), you can
instead do

```sh
pip install numpy numpy-quaternion
```

If you refuse to use `conda`, you might want to install inside your
home directory without root privileges.  (Anaconda does this by
default anyway.)  This is done by adding `--user` to the above
command:

```sh
pip install --user numpy numpy-quaternion
```

Pre-built binaries will usually be chosen by `pip`.  If none are
available for your configuration, pip will attempt to compile the code
— which requires a working `C` compiler.

Finally, there's also the fully manual option of just downloading the
code, changing to the code directory, and running

```sh
python setup.py install
```

This should work regardless of the installation method, as long as you
have a compiler hanging around.  However, note that you will need to
have at least `numpy` installed already, as noted above.


## Usage

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import quaternion
>>> np.quaternion(1,0,0,0)
quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0)
>>> q1 = np.quaternion(1,2,3,4)
>>> q2 = np.quaternion(5,6,7,8)
>>> q1 * q2
quaternion(-60, 12, 30, 24)
>>> a = np.array([q1, q2])
>>> a
array([quaternion(1, 2, 3, 4), quaternion(5, 6, 7, 8)], dtype=quaternion)
>>> exp(a)
array([quaternion(1.69392, -0.78956, -1.18434, -1.57912),
       quaternion(138.909, -25.6861, -29.9671, -34.2481)], dtype=quaternion)
```

The following ufuncs are implemented (which means they run fast on
numpy arrays):

```python
add, subtract, multiply, divide, log, exp, power, negative, conjugate,
copysign, equal, not_equal, less, less_equal, isnan, isinf, isfinite, absolute
```

Quaternion components are stored as doubles.  Numpy arrays with
`dtype=quaternion` can be accessed as arrays of doubles without any
(slow, memory-consuming) copying of data; rather, a `view` of the
exact same memory space can be created within a microsecond,
regardless of the shape or size of the quaternion array.

Comparison operations follow the same lexicographic ordering as
tuples.

The unary tests isnan and isinf return true if they would return true
for any individual component; isfinite returns true if it would return
true for all components.

Real types may be cast to quaternions, giving quaternions with zero
for all three imaginary components. Complex types may also be cast to
quaternions, with their single imaginary component becoming the first
imaginary component of the quaternion. Quaternions may not be cast to
real or complex types.

Several array-conversion functions are also included.  For example, to
convert an Nx4 array of floats to an N-dimensional array of
quaternions, use `as_quat_array`:
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import quaternion
>>> a = np.random.rand(7, 4)
>>> a
array([[ 0.93138726,  0.46972279,  0.18706385,  0.86605021],
       [ 0.70633523,  0.69982741,  0.93303559,  0.61440879],
       [ 0.79334456,  0.65912598,  0.0711557 ,  0.46622885],
       [ 0.88185987,  0.9391296 ,  0.73670503,  0.27115149],
       [ 0.49176628,  0.56688076,  0.13216632,  0.33309146],
       [ 0.11951624,  0.86804078,  0.77968826,  0.37229404],
       [ 0.33187593,  0.53391165,  0.8577846 ,  0.18336855]])
>>> qs = quaternion.as_quat_array(a)
>>> qs
array([ quaternion(0.931387262880247, 0.469722787598354, 0.187063852060487, 0.866050210100621),
       quaternion(0.706335233363319, 0.69982740767353, 0.933035590130247, 0.614408786768725),
       quaternion(0.793344561317281, 0.659125976566815, 0.0711557025000925, 0.466228847713644),
       quaternion(0.881859869074069, 0.939129602918467, 0.736705031709562, 0.271151494174001),
       quaternion(0.491766284854505, 0.566880763189927, 0.132166320200012, 0.333091463422536),
       quaternion(0.119516238634238, 0.86804077992676, 0.779688263524229, 0.372294043850009),
       quaternion(0.331875925159073, 0.533911652483908, 0.857784598617977, 0.183368547490701)], dtype=quaternion)
```
[Note that quaternions are printed with full precision, unlike floats,
which is why you see extra digits above.  But the actual data is
identical in the two cases.]  To convert an N-dimensional array of
quaternions to an Nx4 array of floats, use `as_float_array`:
```python
>>> b = quaternion.as_float_array(qs)
>>> b
array([[ 0.93138726,  0.46972279,  0.18706385,  0.86605021],
       [ 0.70633523,  0.69982741,  0.93303559,  0.61440879],
       [ 0.79334456,  0.65912598,  0.0711557 ,  0.46622885],
       [ 0.88185987,  0.9391296 ,  0.73670503,  0.27115149],
       [ 0.49176628,  0.56688076,  0.13216632,  0.33309146],
       [ 0.11951624,  0.86804078,  0.77968826,  0.37229404],
       [ 0.33187593,  0.53391165,  0.8577846 ,  0.18336855]])
```

It is also possible to convert a quaternion to or from a 3x3 array of
floats representing a rotation matrix, or an array of N quaternions to
or from an Nx3x3 array of floats representing N rotation matrices,
using `as_rotation_matrix` and `from_rotation_matrix`.  Similar
conversions are possible for rotation vectors using
`as_rotation_vector` and `from_rotation_vector`, and for spherical
coordinates using `as_spherical_coords` and `from_spherical_coords`.
Finally, it is possible to derive the Euler angles from a quaternion
using `as_euler_angles`, or create a quaternion from Euler angles
using `from_euler_angles` — though be aware that Euler angles are
basically the worst things
ever.<sup>[1](#1-euler-angles-are-awful)</sup> Before you complain
about those functions using something other than your favorite
conventions, please read [this

## Bug reports and feature requests

Bug reports and feature requests are entirely welcome (with [very few
exceptions](https://github.com/moble/quaternion/wiki/Euler-angles-are-horrible#opening-issues-and-pull-requests)).
The best way to do this is to open an [issue on this code's github
page](https://github.com/moble/quaternion/issues).  For bug reports,
please try to include a minimal working example demonstrating the
problem.

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
are also entirely welcome, of course, if you have an idea where the
code is going wrong, or have an idea for a new feature that you know
how to implement.

This code is [routinely
tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion) on recent versions of
both python (2.7 and 3.6) and numpy (>=1.7).  But the test coverage is
not necessarily as complete as it could be, so bugs may certainly be
present, especially in the higher-level functions like
`mean_rotor_...`.


## Acknowledgments

This code is, of course, hosted on github.  Because it is an
open-source project, the hosting is free, and all the wonderful
features of github are available, including free wiki space and web
page hosting, pull requests, a nice interface to the git logs, etc.
Github user Hannes Ovrén (hovren) pointed out some errors in a
previous version of this code and suggested some nice utility
functions for rotation matrices, etc.  Github user Stijn van Drongelen
(rhymoid) contributed some code that makes compilation work with
MSVC++.  Github user Jon Long (longjon) has provided some elegant
contributions to substantially improve several tricky parts of this
code.

Every change in this code is [automatically
tested](https://travis-ci.org/moble/quaternion) on
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/).  This service integrates
beautifully with github, detecting each commit and automatically
re-running the tests.  The code is downloaded and installed fresh each
time, and then tested, on each of the five different versions of
python.  This ensures that no change I make to the code breaks either
installation or any of the features that I have written tests for.
Travis-CI also automatically builds the `conda` and `pip` versions of
the code hosted on
[anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/moble/quaternion) and
[pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy-quaternion) respectively.
These are all free services for open-source projects like this one.

The work of creating this code was supported in part by the Sherman
Fairchild Foundation and by NSF Grants No. PHY-1306125 and
AST-1333129.

###### <sup>1</sup> Euler angles are awful

Euler angles are pretty much [the worst things
ever](http://moble.github.io/spherical_functions/#euler-angles) and it
makes me feel bad even supporting them.  Quaternions are faster, more
accurate, basically free of singularities, more intuitive, and
generally easier to understand.  You can work entirely without Euler
angles (I certainly do).  You absolutely never need them.  But if
you're so old fashioned that you really can't give them up, they are
supported.
